.synopsis
Configure the WinTrialLab cloud builder VM
.description
Perform deployment work on the system, including installing Powershell DSC prerequisite modules, creating the DSC MOF files, and actually running the configuration.
.parameter wtlRepoZipUri
The URI to the wintriallab repository zipfile generated by GitHub.
Note that we rely on GitHub's behavior of creating a zipfile with a single directory in the root, and all files in the repo added under that directory, but that we do not have to know the name of the directory beforehand.
.parameter runLocal
If *not* passed, assume that this script has been downloaded alone; download the WTL zip file and extract it before using resources found in it to continue.
If passed, assume that this script is running in a checked-out copy WTL repo, and use $PSScriptRoot to find other resources. Also, run DSC configurations with -Force (rationale: we are probably trying things, having them fail, and trying again; without -Force, DSC will not attempt a new configuration after a failure.
.parameter packerUserName
The name for the Packer user. User must already exist.
.parameter packerUserPassword
The password for the Packer user.
.parameter eventLogName
The name of the event log to use during initial setup. Created if nonexistent. Note that DSC logs are sent to the normal event log, not the one named here.
.parameter eventLogSource
Arbitrary string to use as a name to use for the "source" of the event log entries we create.
.parameter installDebuggingTools
Install tools that are helpful for troubleshooting and debugging my DSC configuration on the VM.

Development notes:

Do *not* use $PSScriptRoot to reference other files in the repository. This script is downloaded and run to clone the repo. Once the repo is cloned, reference files from $wtlCheckoutDir

Note that the DSC `Configuration` blocks can *not* be part of this file, even though it's dot-sourced and it looks like it could be added. This is because this script installs DSC resources. The DSC configurations load them via `Import-DscResource`, which is *not* a cmdlet, but is a dynamic keyword. Because it's a keyword, it isn't encapsulated in the `Configuration` and run when the configuration is invoked, but is actually run as soon as the script executes - and in this case, since this script is installing those DSC resources, that means it will run before the resources are installed, and therefore fail. Note also that even encapsulating the `Configuration` block in a scriptblock that is executed later will still result in an error. For these reasons, the DSC configuration itself must exist in a separate file which is called from this deployment script.

We go to some effort to make sure that this script doesn't have to know much about the wintriallab repository. In fact, it doesn't even need git installed, since we can just download the zipfile from GitHub. That said, we do rely on the structure of the zipfile that GitHub generates, as mentioned above.
